                <p>
                   I was born on September 1, 1999, in São Miguel, a small town in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. My life has been shaped by simplicity, curiosity, and an enduring search for understanding the world around me. Growing up in a modest environment, I developed an early fascination with questions that others often ignored — questions about existence, time, gravity, and the nature of reality itself.

                    Despite facing some personal and educational challenges, I remained focused and determined to keep learning. In 2024, I completed high school as the top student in my class. I consistently achieved high grades and earned recognition as a standout student, not only for academic performance but also for my dedication to self-taught study in philosophy, physics, and mathematics.

                <p>
                    Over time, my independent studies and reflections led me to develop the Primordial Mesh Theory (TMP) — a personal theoretical framework that seeks to explain gravity, light, time, and energy through the concept of a fundamental "mesh" that underlies reality. According to TMP, space is not an empty vacuum but a living, dynamic network — a primordial structure whose fluctuations, tension gradients, and energy densities give rise to all known physical phenomena.

                <p>
                    TMP is not merely a theory of physics, but a philosophical proposal that combines ancient wisdom with modern intuition. Influenced by thinkers such as Seneca, Epictetus, and Solomon, the theory reflects a deeper understanding of intention, consciousness, and the unseen forces that shape both the cosmos and human life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I continue to write, research, and refine the ideas behind TMP, aiming to share them with others who — like me — believe that the universe still holds truths yet to be discovered.
